The **Boca Juniors API** is a RESTful API designed for developers and HINCHAS. It provides detailed information about **Club Atl√©tico Boca Juniors**, including matches, tournaments, players, etc. <br> It was created to power my **front-end project**, where users can register the matches they attended live at the stadium and track their unforgettable experiences at the stadiums.
